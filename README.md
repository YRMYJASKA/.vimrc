  * Not needed and is automatically disabled in the vim configuation, but 
  settings are still there in case they are used. YCM must be installed separately

  Clone the reposotory into the directory ~/vimrc

  Vundle.vim(https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) and place the .vimrc file into the home direcotry 
  
  **NOTE: this will destroy any current vim configurations in the .vimrc file, 
  so I would suggest backing up any current configuration before installing!**
